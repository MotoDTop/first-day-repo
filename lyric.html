        <p>Faith No More
            'We Care a Lot'
            1987

            The breakthrough single from Bay Area hybridists Faith No More is a spittle-flecked sneer at the self-serving grandiosity of Eighties pop-star charity benefits like Live Aid and “We Are the World.” While “Care” vocalist Chuck Mosley departed the band in 1988, the cut’s prominent bass and uneasiness-inducing synths — as well as its eye-rolling attitude toward squeaky-clean mass culture — remain hallmarks of the Faith No More aesthetic. “It’s totally a different band in a lot of ways — totally different singer, it’s played by a bunch of 21-year-old kids who are very naive, and you can hear the naiveté in the music,” bassist Bill Gould said in a 2016 interview. “It’s very primitive in some ways, but at the same time, it’s interesting for people who know Faith No More now.”

        I can't stop this feeling
        Deep inside of me
        Girl, you just don't realize
        What you do to me
        When you hold me

        In your arms so tight
        You let me know
        Everything's alright
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        Lips as sweet as candy
        It's taste is on my mind
        Girl, you got me thirsty
        For another cup of wine
        Got a bug from you girl
        But I don't need no cure
        I just stay a victim

        <!--add jS for this button-->

        If I can for sure
        All the good love
        When we're all alone
        Keep it up girl
        Yeah, you turn me on
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        All the good love
        When we're all alone
        Keep it up, girl
        Yeah, you turn me on

        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        And I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I said I'm hooked on a feeling
        And I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I'm hooked on a feeling
