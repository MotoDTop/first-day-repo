        I can't stop this feeling
        Deep inside of me
        Girl, you just don't realize
        What you do to me
        When you hold me

        In your arms so tight
        You let me know
        Everything's alright
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        Lips as sweet as candy
        It's taste is on my mind
        Girl, you got me thirsty
        For another cup of wine
        Got a bug from you girl
        But I don't need no cure
        I just stay a victim

        If I can for sure
        All the good love
        When we're all alone
        Keep it up girl
        Yeah, you turn me on
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        All the good love
        When we're all alone
        Keep it up, girl
        Yeah, you turn me on

        I'm hooked on a feeling
        I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I'm hooked on a feeling
        And I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I said I'm hooked on a feeling
        And I'm high on believing
        That you're in love with me
        I'm hooked on a feeling
